#### Kickfurther Code Challenge

Most weather apps will ask you to input your city or zipcode, and then will give you a sense what the weather is going
to be like in that city. This is all well and good if you're in a major locality, but not very helpful if you're going
to be off the grid.

Your task is to build a small application to try to solve this problem.

As a user, I should be able to come to your site, see a map, and click on the map to get a sense for the weather forecast
at that point. Clicking on another point should update the forecast.

Additionally, I should be able to save this point to a 'favorites' list, that persists in a database. Note: For this
contrived example, it's not necessary to build a user authentication system in place, favorites can simply be shared
across all users.

At a minimum, please make use of the following two API's:
(Dark Sky)[https://darksky.net/dev/docs]
(Google Maps)[https://developers.google.com/maps/]

In building this application, you are free to use any language, framework, and database that you're most comfortable with. 
Your implementation will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1) User usability
2) Use of database
3) Use of external API's
4) Readability (how easy is it for another engineer to understand what you've done)
5) In addition to you application implementation, please provide a brief README that explains to any user (or evaluator)
how to get the app up and running locally, how to run any relevant tests, and a brief explanation of any pertinent
design decisions.

Please post all of your code to a public Github repository, and submit that link to the team.

Happy coding!
